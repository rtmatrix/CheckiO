Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing 
ree respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win
 or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D."
x-o-referee
A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
Input: A game's result. A list of strings (Unicode).
Output: "X", "O" or "D". A string.

Example:
checkio([
    "X.O",
    "XX.",
    "XOO"]) == "X", "Xs wins"
checkio([
    "OO.",
    "XOX",
    "XOX"]) == "O"
checkio([
    "OOX",
    "XXO",
    "OXX"]) == "D"
How it is used: This task will help you to look at iterating data types. It is also used in games' algorithms.
